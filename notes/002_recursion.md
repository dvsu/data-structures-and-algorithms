# Part 2: Recursion

## Definition

> Recursion is a technique by which a function makes one or more calls to itself during execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of the very same type of structure in its representation.

## Examples of Recursion

- Factorial function _(n!)_
- English ruler, e.g. fractal structure
- Binary search
- File system, e.g. exploring nested files and directories
